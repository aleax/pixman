Here are the steps to follow to create a new pixman release:

1) Ensure that there are no uncommitted changes or unpushed commits,
   and that you are up to date with the latest commits in the central
   repository. Here are a couple of useful commands:

	# This should report "nothing to commit (working directory clean")
	git status

	# This should give no output, (note there are *3* dots)
	git log master...origin

2) Verify that the code passes "make distcheck".

	NOTE: There is some test code in the test directory, but it's
	not yet integrated into "make distcheck" yet. It might be
	useful to run those programs, (but I don't know how to
	interpret those results). Another very useful thing to do is
	to run the cairo test suite against pixman. This can be done
	by running the following commands with the latest cairo
	release:

		tar xzf cairo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
		cd cairo
		CAIRO_TEST_TARGET=image make test

4) Increment pixman_{major|minor|micro} in configure.ac according to
   the directions in that file. Also note that if there is an ABI
   change then there is further work to be done, (also described in
   configure.in).

5) Use "git commit" record any changes made in steps 3 and 4.

6) Generate the final tar files with

	make distcheck

   And publish the tar files to everywhere appropriate.

   Note: There's a "make release-publish" target to help with this
   step, (creating the tar file and publishing it), but it depends on
   getting gpg setup first. It's probably the right way to go in the
   future, though.

7) Increment pixman_micro to the next larger (odd) number in
   configure.ac. Commit this change, and push all commits created
   during this process.

8) Send email announcements of the release to everywhere appropriate.
